# Terraform AWS Orgs Guardrails

## Service Control Policies (SCPs)

The following SCPs should only be applied after the account has been configured properly. The pre-configuration includes all security tools and IAM permissions. The recommended best practice is to create an on-boarding Organizational Unit that has limited permissions to deploy your tools and then move the account into an OU that has the security guardrails attached.

## Security Guardrails

### Account

- Denies the ability to enable or disable a region.
- By default, when new regions are enabled by AWS, you now have to enable that region before IAM will propogate. 
- This policy can be used to lock down the ability to launch resources in unapproved regions or deny a malicious actor from disabling a region in your account. 
- When a region is disabled, and there are IAM resources in that region, they will be removed. Please view the documentation [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-permissions-to-enable-accounts-for-upcoming-aws-regions/) for more information.

### AWS Config

- Denies the ability to delete AWS Config rules and stop recording. 
- AWS Config is a service to monitor your resources for point-in-time configuration updates and compliance monitoring. 
- Malicious actors may try to stop AWS Config recording and perform destructive behavior so it is important to deny AWS Config deletions.

### CloudTrail

- Denies the ability to delete CloudTrail trails. 
- CloudTrail monitors all API calls against (supported) resources. 
- Please note that not all AWS services and resources are supported by CloudTrail.
- Because CloudTrail is a record of all API calls made, it is commonly targeted to cover malicious actors' tracks.

### EC2

- Requires MFA when deleting or stopping EC2 instances.
- A best practice is to protect your resources from accidental deletions and requiring MFA is one step in that direction. 

### GuardDuty

- Denies the ability to remove the assigned account from the GuardDuty master. 
- Once GuardDuty is in place for an account, it should not be removed while in use. 

### IAM

- Requires MFA to be set before any action can be performed. 
- The user will only be able to set a MFA device and then must log out / in to have normal access.
- This is a blanket guardrail that should be used caustiously. Keep in mine that unless the user authenticated with MFA via the CLI, access keys will not be valid. 

### AWS Organizations

- Denies the ability to remove an account from the AWS Organization it is assigned to.

### S3

- Requires all S3 Uploads to use Encryption at Rest.
- Denies non-TLS S3 Requests
- Requires MFA When Deleting Objects
- Recommended best practice is to encrypt everything in s3. These rules require encryption at rest and in transit.

### AWS Shield

- Denies the ability to remove AWS Shield protection or update the emergency contact information.
- AWS Shield is a DDoS protection service which should be turned on 24/7.

### VPC

- Denies the ability to delete VPC Flow Logs.
- VPC Flow Logs are your network monitoring logs and provide visibility into anomalous traffic during a security event.
